            "name": "Visually Guided Finger Movements Task",
            "definition": "Participants performed index finger movements ('action') and observed movements ('observation') with four different types of visual feedback: a simple circular cursor (CU), a point light (PL) pattern indicating finger joint positions, a shadow cartoon hand (SH), and a realistic virtual hand (VH). Finger movements were recorded using a data glove, and eye-tracking was recorded optically. The task involved moving a cursor to a target position and back to the starting position within a specified time frame.",
