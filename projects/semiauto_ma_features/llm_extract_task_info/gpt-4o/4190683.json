            "definition": "The Stop Task is a mixed-trial, event-related tracking fMRI task that measures the ability to suppress an already triggered motor response. Participants respond to go arrows pointing either right or left with a corresponding button press. In 20% of trials, a stop signal follows the go signal, and participants must inhibit their motor response. A tracking algorithm adjusts the time interval between go and stop signals to achieve 50% successful and 50% unsuccessful inhibition trials.",
