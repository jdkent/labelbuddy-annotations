Each picture was presented on the screen for 3 s followed by an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 1 s in a pseudo-randomized order. Each picture block was followed by a short rest in which participants saw a fixation cross presented in the middle of the screen for 24 s. Participants were instructed to pay careful attention to the presented pictures, as they would be required to complete a subsequent memory task. Participants were also instructed to make indoor-outdoor judgments for each picture, ensuring that participants paid attention to the task. Each picture block contained an equal number of indoor and outdoor scenes.",
