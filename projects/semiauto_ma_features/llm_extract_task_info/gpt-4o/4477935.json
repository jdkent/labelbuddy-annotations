            "definition": "Participants were presented with a rule symbol on a computer screen for 1000ms, followed by a blank screen for 500ms before a response symbol appeared. Participants had a window of 2500ms to respond and received feedback immediately after the motor response. The task included two levels of conflict: bivalent rules and univalent rules. Bivalent trials involved response symbols that had different meanings depending on the current rule active, while univalent trials had fixed responses.",
