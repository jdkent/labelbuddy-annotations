            "definition": "Participants learned events comprising multiple overlapping pairs of event elements (e.g., person\u2013location, object\u2013location, location\u2013person). Encoding occurred either immediately before or 24 hours before retrieval. During retrieval, participants performed a six-alternative forced-choice cued-recognition task where they were presented with a cue and six potential targets and had to identify the correct target.",
