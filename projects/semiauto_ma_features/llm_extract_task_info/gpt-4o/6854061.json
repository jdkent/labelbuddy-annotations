            "definition": "A disorder-specific fMRI task composed of 48 agoraphobia-related (e.g., scenes of subways, crowds) and 48 neutral pictures from the International Affective Picture System. The pictures were presented randomly to produce reciprocal emotions and anxiety-specific brain activation. Half of the pictures were cued by the words 'panic' or 'neutral' and the other half with a non-specific letter combination 'DGHNTFJ'. Each picture was presented for 2000 ms and each cue for 250 ms. The stimuli were separated by the presentation of a fixation cross (variable period of 2\u20134 s) with the objective of minimizing eye movements. The duration of the inter-trial intervals varied between 2 and 6 s. Participants were instructed to pay attention to the picture content, to imagine being in the shown situation and to confirm each presentation of a picture with a button press. All pictures were rated related to agoraphobic anxiety after the fMRI scan.",
