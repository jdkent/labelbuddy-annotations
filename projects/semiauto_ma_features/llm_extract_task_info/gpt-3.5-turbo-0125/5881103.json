            "contrasts": "In the L1-L2 context, no significant differences in neural activations between congruent and incongruent conditions. In the L2-L3 context, incongruent conditions involved extra neural responses in the right inferior frontal gyrus and left supramarginal gyrus. In the L1-L3 context, both congruent and incongruent trials evoked neural activities in the right prefrontal cortex, right insula, and subcortical areas."

Incongruent trials showed additional brain activations in the left inferior parietal lobe in the L1-L2 context, right inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral insula, left rolandic operculum, bilateral supramarginal gyrus, and right thalamus in the L2-L3 context, and right prefrontal cortex, right insula, and subcortical areas in the L1-L3 context.",
            "contrasts": "In the L1-L2 context, no significant differences in neural activations between congruent and incongruent conditions. In the L2-L3 context, the flanker effect was associated with activations in the right inferior frontal gyrus and left cerebellum. In the L1-L3 context, activations in the right middle frontal gyrus, right inferior frontal gyrus, and left insula were associated with the flanker effect."
