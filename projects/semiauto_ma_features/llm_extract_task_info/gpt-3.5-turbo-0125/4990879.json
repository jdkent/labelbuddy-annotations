            "description": "Participants underwent resting-state fMRI scans to analyze regional homogeneity (ReHo) differences between heroin relapsers and non-relapsers under methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). ReHo measures the coherence of intraregional spontaneous low-frequency blood oxygenation level-dependent signal fluctuations in voxel-wise analysis across the whole brain.",
